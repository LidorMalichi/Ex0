# Bereshit Landing Simulation and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project simulates the landing of the Bereshit spacecraft, designed as part of an Aerospace Engineering course project. The simulation models key parameters such as altitude, vertical speed, horizontal speed, angle, and fuel consumption during the descent.

The simulation uses PID controllers to adjust the vertical speed and angle based on altitude, and it tracks the fuel consumption over time. The output data is stored in a CSV file and visualized using Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

## Features

#### Simulation of Landing: The physics of the landing are modeled, adjusting for fuel consumption, acceleration, and descent speed.

#### CSV Export: The simulation results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.


## Technical Report:

A Technical Report(BereshitReport.pdf) has been added to analyze the crash of the Bereshit spacecraft, providing a detailed breakdown of the incident. The report also outlines the simulation used to model the landing sequence, the assumptions made during the simulation, and the results obtained from various parameters such as altitude, vertical speed, horizontal speed, angle, and fuel consumption. Through this simulation, we aim to identify the factors contributing to the crash, further explaining both the methodology of our simulation.
