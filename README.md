# Bereshit Landing Simulation and Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates the landing sequence of the Bereshit spacecraft as part of an Aerospace Engineering course. The simulation models key flight parameters such as:

- Altitude
- Vertical speed
- Horizontal speed
- Descent angle
- Fuel consumption

PID controllers dynamically adjust vertical speed, horizontal speed, and angle based on altitude. The simulation outputs are saved to an Excel file and visualized for analysis.

## 📄 Technical Report

A detailed technical report (`BereshitReport.pdf`) is included in the repository. It provides:

- A breakdown of the crash scenario
- The simulation methodology
- Assumptions made during modeling
- Graphs of altitude, speed, angle, and fuel use
- PID controller behavior throughout each landing phase

This project aims to explore the contributing factors to the Bereshit crash and to demonstrate the role of simulation and control systems in aerospace analysis.
