# Bereshit Landing Simulation and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project simulates the landing of the Bereshit spacecraft, designed as part of an Aerospace Engineering course project. The simulation models key parameters such as altitude, vertical speed, horizontal speed, angle, and fuel consumption during the descent.

The simulation uses PID controllers to adjust the vertical speed and angle based on altitude, and it tracks the fuel consumption over time. The output data is stored in a CSV file and visualized using Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

## Features
Simulation of Landing: The physics of the landing are modeled, adjusting for fuel consumption, acceleration, and descent speed.

PID Controllers: Two PID controllers are used to control the vertical speed and the angle during the descent.

Data Visualization: The simulation data is visualized with 5 plots to help analyze the landing process.

CSV Export: The simulation results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Python Script: plot_landing.py

Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or higher

Required Python libraries:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

### You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
How to Run the Python Script
Export CSV: First, ensure that you have the landing_report.csv file. This CSV file is generated by running the Java-based landing simulation (Bereshit_101.java). The CSV file contains the simulation data including time, vertical speed, horizontal speed, altitude, angle, fuel, and acceleration.

Run the Python Script: Once you have the landing_report.csv file, you can run the Python script to generate the plots. Make sure that the plot_landing.py script is in the same directory as the CSV file.

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
python plot_landing.py
View the Results: After running the script, it will generate a plot showing 5 graphs of the simulation's key metrics: altitude, vertical speed, horizontal speed, angle, and fuel. The plot will be saved as bereshit_landing_cleaned.png in the current directory.

You can view the plot with your preferred image viewer.

## Description of the Plots:
Altitude vs Time: Shows the descent of the spacecraft over time.

Vertical Speed vs Time: Tracks the vertical speed during descent.

Horizontal Speed vs Time: Shows the horizontal speed of the spacecraft.

Angle vs Time: Tracks the angle of the spacecraft.

Fuel vs Time: Monitors the fuel consumption over time.
